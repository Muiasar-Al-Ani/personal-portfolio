# My Personal Portfolio 

This my personal portfolio that I created using only HTML and CSS. I added in the CSS file some Media Queries to have a better support for mobile in portrait and landscape modes. Also, I included support for devices with smaller screens.

## Technologies:

* HTML to write the structure of the website.
* CSS to style the website.

##  Editors 

* [Microsoft Visual Studio code:]( https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ ) this an awesome all around editor that is highly recommended by most software and web developers.
* [Notepad ++:]( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ )  this a very light weight code editor that packs a big punch.

## Validators 

* [HTML Validator]( https://validator.w3.org/ ) : I validated my html file with this w3 validator  which I highly recommend. 
* [CSS Validator]( https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ ) : And I highly recommend their CSS validator.
